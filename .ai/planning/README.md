## Document Status

All documents are in **high-level planning** status. Detailed task breakdowns and deep dives will be created before each phase of implementation begins.

## Next Steps

1. Review and refine these planning documents based on additional research
2. Research Cisco IP Phone XML format specifications in detail
3. Set up development environment
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation (Project Setup and Foundation)

## Updates

These documents should be updated as:
- Requirements change or become clearer
- Architecture decisions are finalized
- Technology choices are confirmed
- Implementation reveals new considerations
